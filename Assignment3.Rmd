# Analyzing coefficients:


# For every 1% increase in risk reduction, there is an increase in probablility of voting YES by 0.0007445.
# For every $1 increase in cost per household, there is a decrease in probability of voting YES by 0.0010699.
# For every additional point increase for NEP score, there is an increase in probability of voting YES by 0.0158639.
# Individuals in the top one percent income category are 0.0088282 more likely to vote YES than individuals in the middle income class.
# Individuals in the poor income category are 0.0027386 more likely to vote YES than inidividuals in the middle income category. 
# Individuals in the rich income category are 0.0074891 more likely to vote YES than inidividuals in the middle income category.
# Individuals in the very rich income category are 0.0467922 more likely to vote YES than inidividuals in the middle income category.

# Age to fifty individuals are 0.0099816 more likely to vote YES than age over 60.

## Based on this regression, what can you say about the value of a single prevented whale death? (Hint: Think about how risk reduction for all whales translates into the number of whale deaths avoided)
